# Gray Television, Inc. (GTN)

#### Overview
I try my best to stick to industries that I’m at least somewhat familiar with, but the next equity that I added to my portfolio was too valuable to pass up, and it was in a space where I never anticipated having a stake: Television Media. Gray Television has demonstrated an ability to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flows in a space that some might dismiss as “dying” due to the rise of streaming services. Best of all, as they’ve boosted earnings while simultaneously improving their financial position, owning a piece of their free cash flows and earnings has gotten cheaper. Through my analysis and modeling, I found a significant margin of safety between Gray Television’s present price of $20.15 and the intrinsic value of one share of Gray Television. I’ll dive into my analysis soon, but first, an overview of Gray Television, Inc.

Gray Television’s core operations include the ownership and operation of roughly 100 TV stations. The vast majority of these are local news stations, and most are affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox. Their stations are spread across the country, but they mostly cover markets in the Southern and Eastern parts of the United States. Their market coverage is heavily diversified, though. In 2019 and 2020, Gray’s largest markets, Charlotte and Cleveland, each produced only 4% of their total revenue. Their top 10 markets contributed a combined 24% of revenue for 2020. The map below shows the geographic diversification of Gray’s stations.

#### Analysis


In 2020, 91% of Gray Television stations were ranked either #1 or #2 in their market in overall audience. Stronger ratings and high station rankings give these stations strong competitive advantages, as a large amount of revenue comes from advertising and partnerships, which are more plentiful when stations have strong viewership. Another great aspect of Gray’s diversification is that no single advertising customer provides more than 5% of Gray’s advertising revenue. In addition to advertising advantages, owning top-ranked stations allows Gray’s stations to hire top talent and negotiate more favorable contracts with affiliates. All of these are crucial competitive advantages in the television space. In sum, Gray’s stations have risen to the top of their markets, and the accompanying benefits have the potential to increase operating margins, raise earnings, and thicken free cash flows. 

Gray might first appear as a growth stock, as they have had tremendous revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth in recent years. But make no mistake, Gray is available at a bargain price, and its cheap cash flows are its most enticing characteristic. We’ll start, first, with its financial position, which might raise a flag or two for those seeking an ironclad financial position. I’ll be up front. Gray Television is the most leveraged security on this blog. This presents risk, as Gray Television may run into trouble paying its debts, which could reduce operational flexibility. However, we have the opportunity for higher returns on equity and greater returns relative to our own investment. And Gray Television is still able to cover their obligations. interest coverage is sitting at 3.8x, its highest in the past decade. In addition, Gray is gradually becoming less leveraged. Their debt/equity ratio over time is graphed below:

Gray has a healthy and improving financial position, and although they’re a bit more leveraged than my liking, the benefits of their growth and relative cheapness far outweigh the negatives of this financial position.

I see Gray Television as a value play, but they’ve also shown significant revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth over the last decade. Over the past 10 years, revenues have compounded at an average annual rate of 19%. EPS has compounded at an average annual rate of 37%. As you can see from the graph below, Gray made tremendous gains in the past decade, but growth has slowed. Over the past 3 years, EPS grew at an average annual rate of 15% and Free Cash Flow grew at an average rate of 24%. Don’t get me wrong, these numbers are still signs of exemplary growth. Earnings margins and cash flow margins were stronger in the past 5 years than they were in the preceding five, and remember, Gray is the least leveraged that it’s been in the past decade. Strong growth in revenues and earnings paired with deleveraging makes for a beautiful combination. Gray is able to strengthen their financial position without having to ease off of the gas pedal of earnings growth.

#### Valuation



I did a simplified version of a discounted free cash flow model. I projected out free cash flows and discounted them back using a 15% discount rate. Because I’m not an expert on Korean telecom companies, or even telecom companies for that matter, I wanted to build in a strong margin of safety, so I chose a discount rate that would require returns significantly higher than the lifetime average S&P 500 return of 8%. Assuming no free cash flow growth, I found an intrinsic value of between $19 and $25 per share for our 15% discount rate/annual return. I used a variety of free cash flow estimates and consolidated my results into an intrinsic value range. The free cash flow estimates were created using the following: KT’s free cash flow figure from 2020; average free cash flow of the past 5 years; and average free cash flow of the past 10 years. After doing the full discounting calculations using these different estimates, I consolidated my results to create an intrinsic value range of $19-$25. These projections are far from perfect, but they tell a story of an undervalued KT that can provide returns north of 15% if cash flows persist at their current level and the stock is purchased at its current price of $11.53. But let’s say free cash flow can’t stay this high. Even with free cash flow decreasing at 5% per year, KT’s intrinsic value still sits in the $15-$18 range based on my projections (These projections were also based on a 15% discount rate). I’m no modeling expert, but these calculations were a major factor in my investment decision because of the unemotional, objective nature of the calculations and the strong margin of safety that they revealed.
  
#### Conclusion

It is clear to me that KT offers an adequate margin of safety. Not only do they provide stable earnings and predictable cash flows at a significantly cheaper price than their competitors, but there is a significant gap between my calculated intrinsic value and the price of KT Corp stock. Even after building in a conservative discount factor, I found a significant margin of safety unseen in any of the past companies that I’ve analyzed. With this margin of safety, I see sublime value in owning stock in KT Corp. I have confidence that KT will continue to pump out strong free cash flows, meet its intrinsic value over time, and compound capital over the long-term.
