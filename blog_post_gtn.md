# Gray Television, Inc. (GTN)

#### Overview
I try my best to stick to industries that I’m at least somewhat familiar with, but the next equity that I added to my portfolio was too valuable to pass up, and it was in a space where I never anticipated having a stake: Television Media. Gray Television has demonstrated an ability to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flows in a space that some might dismiss as “dying” due to the rise of streaming services. Best of all, as they’ve boosted earnings while simultaneously improving their financial position, owning a piece of their free cash flows and earnings has gotten cheaper. Through my analysis and modeling, I found a significant margin of safety between Gray Television’s present price of $20.15 and the intrinsic value of one share of Gray Television. I’ll dive into my analysis soon, but first, an overview of Gray Television, Inc.

Gray Television’s core operations include the ownership and operation of roughly 100 TV stations. The vast majority of these are local news stations, and most are affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC, or Fox. Their stations are spread across the country, but they mostly cover markets in the Southern and Eastern parts of the United States. Their market coverage is heavily diversified, though. In 2019 and 2020, Gray’s largest markets, Charlotte and Cleveland, each produced only 4% of their total revenue. Their top 10 markets contributed a combined 24% of revenue for 2020. The map below shows the geographic diversification of Gray’s stations.

#### Analysis


In 2020, 91% of Gray Television stations were ranked either #1 or #2 in their market in overall audience. Stronger ratings and high station rankings give these stations strong competitive advantages, as a large amount of revenue comes from advertising and partnerships, which are more plentiful when stations have strong viewership. Another great aspect of Gray’s diversification is that no single advertising customer provides more than 5% of Gray’s advertising revenue. In addition to advertising advantages, owning top-ranked stations allows Gray’s stations to hire top talent and negotiate more favorable contracts with affiliates. All of these are crucial competitive advantages in the television space. In sum, Gray’s stations have risen to the top of their markets, and the accompanying benefits have the potential to increase operating margins, raise earnings, and thicken free cash flows. 

Gray might first appear as a growth stock, as they have had tremendous revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth in recent years. But make no mistake, Gray is available at a bargain price, and its cheap cash flows are its most enticing characteristic. We’ll start, first, with its financial position, which might raise a flag or two for those seeking an ironclad financial position. I’ll be up front. Gray Television is the most leveraged security on this blog. This presents risk, as Gray Television may run into trouble paying its debts, which could reduce operational flexibility. However, we have the opportunity for higher returns on equity and greater returns relative to our own investment. And Gray Television is still able to cover their obligations. interest coverage is sitting at 3.8x, its highest in the past decade. In addition, Gray is gradually becoming less leveraged. Their debt/equity ratio over time is graphed below:

Gray has a healthy and improving financial position, and although they’re a bit more leveraged than my liking, the benefits of their growth and relative cheapness far outweigh the negatives of this financial position.

I see Gray Television as a value play, but they’ve also shown significant revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth over the last decade. Over the past 10 years, revenues have compounded at an average annual rate of 19%. EPS has compounded at an average annual rate of 37%. As you can see from the graph below, Gray made tremendous gains in the past decade, but growth has slowed. Over the past 3 years, EPS grew at an average annual rate of 15% and Free Cash Flow grew at an average rate of 24%. Don’t get me wrong, these numbers are still signs of exemplary growth. Earnings margins and cash flow margins were stronger in the past 5 years than they were in the preceding five, and remember, Gray is the least leveraged that it’s been in the past decade. Strong growth in revenues and earnings paired with deleveraging makes for a beautiful combination. Gray is able to strengthen their financial position without having to ease off of the gas pedal of earnings growth.

#### Valuation

Gray has demonstrated strong growth, but it is still very much a value play. It’s trading at a steep discount relative to its historical price as well as its competitors. I’ll get to my calculations in a minute, but first I want to dive into its relative cheapness. Of these valuation multiples,. Gray Television’s price/earnings has seen the biggest fall in recent years, but it’s also more volatile than the other valuation ratios. Their current P/E of 5.53 is roughly a third of where it was at in 2019, but it’s also higher than it was in 2018. Other than 2018, their current P/E is at its lowest since 2012, and their average P/E over the past 5 years is 10.51, almost double its current P/E of 5.53. Current Price/Book and year-end-2020 Price/Book are nearly equal (just above 1) and were the lowest since 2012. The same goes for Price/Sales, which is currently sitting around 0.8. But if you’ve read my most recent blog posts, you’ll know that I love cash flows, and Price/Cash Flow paints the clearest picture of Gray’s relative cheapness. The graph below plots Price/Cash flow over the past 5 years.

As we can see from these figures and the graphic, relative to its earnings, cash flow, book value, and sales, Gray is trading a historical discount. 

Relative to its competitors, Gray is also cheap. Against its main competitors, Gray has the lowest P/E and Price/Book. These are traditional value metrics, and Gray definitely checks the boxes here, but like Joel Greenblatt and Bill Ackman, I think cash flows are more important. In similar fashion, Gray has a lower Price/Cash Flow multiple than any of its peers. Nexstar Media is a close second, and Nexstar beat out Gray Television for the top spot in earnings margin and cash flow margin. Nexstar also has a higher return on assets and return on equity. These returns, though, are much more volatile and inconsistent, which makes predicting future returns more difficult. Predictability is important to me when building in a margin of safety, and Gray Television offers more predictable returns and cash flows. In addition, Nexstar is much more leveraged than Gray Television. Gray Television offers a better opportunity to manage risk, and compared to its competitors, Gray offers a bigger slice of earnings and cash flow for your dollar. 

#### Margin of Safety and Conclusion
I found repeated signs of value while doing my research on Gray Television, and there were plenty of hints at the presence of a margin of safety. Sure enough, after building out a complete discounted cash flow model (not the simplified form I used for KT Corp), I found a significant gap between my calculated intrinsic value and the current price of a share. Projecting out free cash flows under varying scenarios (including no growth at all), I estimate the intrinsic value of one share to be between $33 and $41. I maintain that the value of an investment is the present value of the future cash you can get out of the business, so I constructed this model carefully and weighted its results heavily as I made my final decision about whether or not to invest in Gray Television. I am no modeling expert, but the model’s results align with the other signs of value that I found in Gray Television. Gray is trading at historically cheap multiples while demonstrating a convincing ability to grow earnings and cash while improving its financial position. Gray Television is trading at $20.12 as of April 26, 2021. I believe that shares are trading at a healthy discount to the intrinsic value, and I find strong value in owning shares of Gray Television.
